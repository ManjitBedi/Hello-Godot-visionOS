This is work in progress - my goal was to make a new project & manually add the Godot-vision support to it.  It is based on this starter repo: [Godot Vision Starter](https://github.com/kevinw/GodotVisionExample).

More info on Godot Vision here [godot.vision](https://godot.vision).  AFAIK, Godot for visionOS works only with Godot version 4.2.

It is not compiling at the moment. Ugh.
